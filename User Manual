Our program can be used to encrypt and decrypt a .txt file using a Caesar cipher. 
When the application is opened, you can input into a textbox how many times you would like to shift the file, whether encrypting or decrypting. 
Shifting will continue into ASCII, so special characters can be included in the shifting process.
