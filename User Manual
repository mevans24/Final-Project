Our program can be used to encrypt and decrypt a .txt file using a Caesar cipher. 
When the application is opened, you can input into a textbox how many times you would like to shift the file, whether encrypting or decrypting. 
Shifting will continue into ASCII, so special characters can be included in the shifting process. Do not pick a shift value greater than 126, 
it will not work and you will lose your file contents.
There are two buttons, one labeled Encrypt and the other labeled Decrypt. When clicked, your computers downloads window will open, from which you can choose
a .txt file to either encrypt or decrypt. 
Once the file is selected, the contents will be shifted according to your decided shift value and whether you chose encryption or decryption. 
If you wish to decrypt a file that has already been encrypted, make sure that the shift value is the same as when the file was encrypted, and choose to decrypt the file. 
Again, the contents of the file will be changed, and the user must use a .txt file. Any other file type will not work and the file will be left unreadable. 
Make sure that you don't have the file you wish to encrypt/decrypt open while you use the program.
