## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## How to Use

The project is about encryption and decryption of .txt files by using the Caesar Cipher method.
The user enters the number of shifts they are interested in changing their file by, then clicks the “Encrypt” button which leads them to their computer files where they can then pick a .txt file to encrypt. The encryption occurs, and the user can open the file to see it. If they want to decrypt the file they click the “Decrypt” button, pick the same file and shift value again, and the decryption occurs.
